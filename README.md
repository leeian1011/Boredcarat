## Its literally Baccarat minus the convoluted Banker drawing rule.

cargo build takes forever so I play baccarat while I wait it aint that deep.

Also I learnt about how to shuffle an array something about a particular [Fisher-Yate's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle#Fisher_and_Yates'_original_method)

All in all 10/10 experience building this
